Hello Mangesh, it's nice to meet you! I'd be happy to help you write a song. To get started, could you give me a little more information about what you're looking for? For example, do you have a specific theme or topic in mind? Would you like the song to be upbeat, slow, or somewhere in between? Any information you can provide will help me craft a song that meets your needs.

Here's a sample verse and chorus to give you an idea of what I can do:

Verse 1:
The sun rises up over the hills
The birds begin to sing their morning thrill
The world is fresh and new, full of possibility
It's a brand new day, a brand new start for me

Chorus:
I'm gonna seize the day, make the most of every hour
I'm gonna chase my dreams, and never let them cower
I'm gonna live my life with passion, love, and grace
I'm gonna find my place, and make my mark upon this space

I hope this gives you an idea of what I can do. Let me know if you have any specific ideas or requests, and I'll be happy to incorporate them into the song.
